#Change History:
##############################################################
#2.9 -  removed "no_csum" BTRFS status. this is not an actual error, but will be non-zero due to 1.) folders or files with checksums NOT enabled, or BTRFS free space cache that is by default no checksumed. 
#2.8 -	added ability to force the script to display resyncing status of "unsupported" arrays like RAID1, RAID0, and RAID10. This is useful if an unsupported array is being created or repaired
#2.71-	corrected typo in minimum RAID array quantity for "no raid devices found" to be triggered
#2.7 -	added handling of no BTRFS volumes or no RAID devices 
#
#2.6 -	small tweaks, added additional code comments, better wording and formatting of output text
#		script now prints out version within the logs and emails
#		corrected BTRFS scrub percentage calculation. was incorrectly using total volume size, when it should have used the "Used" space of the volume
#
#2.5 - 	fixed an error created in version 2.4 that caused percent calculations to not work correctly during BTRFS scrubs
#2.4 -	added ability for script to handle the situation where a BTRFS volume has never performed a scrub process before. this can happen if the volume was just created. 
#		added ability for script to recognize if RAID array does not support scrubbing (raid 0, raid1, or raid10) and act accordingly 
#		added ability for script to recognize if RAID array is repairing, degraded, or recovering and act accordingly 
#		
#2.3 -	corrected issue with the tracking of BTRFS scrubs that complete in less than 1 hour
#
#2.2 -  moved the BTRFS scrubbing code to before the RAID scrubbing so it is printed first as Synology scrubbing always does BTRFS scrubbing before RAID scrubbing
#		added code to the BTRFS section to determine when the last BTRFS scsrub finished if that particular volume is not active
#		calculate the difference in time since that BTRFS volume was scrubbed
#			this is to assist the script in tracking BTRFS scrubs if the volume's scrub took less than 1 hour to complete.
#			if there is little data (less than a TB) or on an SSD, BTRFS scrubbing can finish fairly quickly. 
#			without this, the script's overall scrub process calculation does not work properly since it would otherwise fail to detect the BTRFS volume scrub.
#		for volumes with inactive BTRFS scrubs, details from the previously completed scrub is now displayed as well. 
#		mdraid status will include RAID type
#		mdraid status will include warnings if the raid status is not "clean" for example if the array is degraded, etc
#			example: WARNING, RAID ARRAY "md2" STATUS ERROR - STATUS IS: "clean, degraded"
#		updated the formatting for the overall progress bar
#
# 2.1 - corrected the "overall" progress bar to properly show up in emails as the " |& tee -a "$log_file_location/$log_file_name"" was missed on the progress bar line
#
# 2.0 - complete rewrite of script to make output more user friendly and add BTRFS % complete, overall scrub $ complete, overall scrub run time and more
